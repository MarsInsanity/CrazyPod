/*
 * Bring-up diagnostics for bugs that only happen on a device, with the
 * owner's own files.
 *
 * Two of them -- an audiobook whose progress bar is wrong and a Game Boy
 * save that never comes back -- survived four rounds of reading the code
 * and guessing, at a test pass each. An on-screen line did not close the
 * gap either: it has to be read, copied and typed back, and the one that
 * matters is a line of hexadecimal.
 *
 * A file does close it, because /.crazypod/perf.log already comes back
 * every round without being asked twice. This appends plain lines to
 * /.crazypod/diag.log: rare events only, opened and closed per line, and
 * capped so it cannot grow without bound.
